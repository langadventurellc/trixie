log:
  - Successfully verified and validated complete router integration with
    comprehensive integration tests. Router integration was already complete in
    main.py and router.py. The missing piece was integration tests to verify
    end-to-end functionality. Implemented comprehensive test suites covering
    complete workflow (setup → proxy → query), route accessibility, error
    handling, and FastAPI docs generation. Fixed critical path normalization
    issue in proxy handler for proper configuration matching. All 69 tests
    passing with full quality check compliance.

# Update Main API Router to Include All Proxy Endpoints

## Context
This task integrates all proxy-related endpoints into the main API router, ensuring they are accessible through the existing `/api` prefix and follow the established routing patterns in the FastAPI application.

**Related Feature**: F-reverse-proxy-api-for-testing - Reverse Proxy API for Testing
**Prerequisites**: 
- T-implement-post-apisetup (setup endpoint)
- T-implement-proxypathpath (proxy handler)
- T-implement-get-apitransactions (transactions endpoint)

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### 1. Update Router Configuration
Modify `src/app/api/router.py` to include all three new proxy-related routers:

**Current Structure**:
```python
from .endpoints import health_check
api_router.include_router(health_check.router)
```

**Required Updates**:
```python
from .endpoints import health_check, proxy_setup, proxy_handler, transactions
api_router.include_router(health_check.router)
api_router.include_router(proxy_setup.router)
api_router.include_router(proxy_handler.router)  
api_router.include_router(transactions.router)
```

### 2. Verify Endpoint Accessibility
Ensure all endpoints are accessible through the main FastAPI app:
- `POST /api/setup` (from proxy_setup router)
- `[GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|etc.] /proxy/{path:path}` (from proxy_handler router)
- `GET /api/transactions` (from transactions router)

### 3. Handle Router Conflicts
Address any potential conflicts:
- Ensure proxy handler routes don't conflict with API routes
- The `/proxy/` routes should be separate from `/api/` routes
- Verify proper route precedence and matching

### 4. Test Router Integration
Create integration tests to verify:
- All endpoints are accessible through the main app
- Routes are properly resolved without conflicts
- The existing health check endpoint still works
- FastAPI's automatic documentation includes all new endpoints

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Steps
1. Import all three new endpoint modules in router.py
2. Add include_router calls for each new router
3. Test endpoint accessibility manually or through automated tests
4. Verify FastAPI docs generation includes all endpoints
5. Add any necessary route configuration or middleware
6. Write integration tests for complete router functionality

### Route Structure Verification
After implementation, verify this route structure:
```
/api/health          (existing health check)
/api/setup           (new proxy configuration)
/api/transactions    (new transaction query)
/proxy/{path:path}   (new proxy handler - note: not under /api/)
```

### Dependencies
- Existing api_router from router.py
- Import statements for all three new endpoint modules
- No additional external dependencies required

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All three new routers properly included in main API router
- POST /api/setup endpoint accessible and functional
- GET /api/transactions endpoint accessible and functional
- Proxy handler routes (/proxy/*) accessible and functional
- Existing health check endpoint remains functional
- No route conflicts or resolution issues

### Integration Verification
- FastAPI automatic documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) includes all endpoints
- All endpoints return proper responses for valid requests
- Error handling works correctly for all endpoints
- Route precedence follows expected patterns

### Code Quality
- Clean import statements following existing patterns
- Proper router inclusion with no duplicate registrations
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Integration tests verify complete functionality
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Documentation
- FastAPI docs automatically generated for all endpoints
- All endpoint documentation reflects correct request/response models
- API documentation accessible at development server docs URLs

## Testing Requirements
Write integration tests covering:
- Complete end-to-end workflow: setup → proxy → query transactions
- Individual endpoint accessibility through main app
- Route resolution correctness
- FastAPI docs generation includes all endpoints
- No regression in existing health check functionality
- Error scenarios work properly across all endpoints

## Out of Scope
- Advanced routing configuration or middleware
- Performance optimization for route resolution
- Custom documentation or API versioning
- Authentication or authorization middleware
- Rate limiting or request throttling
